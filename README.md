# BootCampQuiz
##Discription: I was tasked with creating a webpage that displays questions and a number of possible answers that are on buttons that can be clicked to submit answers. There are a set number of questions and a 60 second timer, if you run out of questions or the timer expires and the quiz is over then the player stores their score and initials in localstorage.
